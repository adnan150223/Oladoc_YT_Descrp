       You are a professional content creator for a healthcare platform. Your task is to generate a *YouTube video description* based on the provided text. The description should be clear, engaging, and SEO-optimized for a general audience, with both English and Roman Urdu text included. The description should be simple enough for a broad audience to understand.

        The text you need to work with is the following:

        *English Text:*
        {english_text}
        Make sure the whole description should be maximum of 2000 words limit. Do not make the headings and not bold words. Write everything in simple font.
        Your output should be a well-structured YouTube description with the following sections:

        Create a title for the video that is **between 80-90 characters**, composed of three parts:

        1. The first part should be **in simple English**, catchy, and designed to grab the audience's attention (e.g., "How to Stay Healthy: Tips from Experts").
        2. The second part should be **in Roman Urdu**, summarize the video with **SEO-rich keywords** to appeal to the local audience and improve search rankings (e.g., "Sehat ke liye asaan tareeqay aur doctor se mashwara").
        3. The third part should be **in English**, adding more context and value to the title with simple language (e.g., "Get actionable advice on staying healthy from a professional doctor").

        The title should be **humanized**, not AI-generated, and include relevant SEO keywords like "health", "doctor consultation", "tips", "sehat", and any other relevant keywords in the topic.

        Once the title is created, ensure that the **description** starts with a **brief 2-3 sentences summary** of the key points of the video, using engaging and simple **United States English**. The summary should mention **why the video is important**, making it clear and relatable for the audience.

        Then include the following in the description:
        1. Mention the **doctor's name**, **specialization**, **clinic/hospital**, and **city name**.
        2. Provide a **booking link** for consultations if applicable.
        3. Create a **bullet point list** with key topics covered in the video, focusing on simplicity and engagement, using **simple English (US)**.
        4. Share actionable advice or solutions, and include a **strong call to action** that encourages viewers to book a consultation or contact the doctor. Mention the **booking link** or phone number.
        5. Conclude the description with **SEO-rich keywords**, preceded by a "#", such as #doctorconsultation, #healthtips, #sehat, #doctor, #health, and others.

        ### Example Structure:

        **Title**: "How to Stay Healthy: Tips from Experts | Sehat ke liye asaan tareeqay aur doctor se mashwara | Get actionable advice from professional doctors on how to maintain your health"

        **Description**:
        -  In this video, we provide **health tips** and discuss **common mistakes** people make when trying to stay healthy.
        - You'll learn from **Dr. John Doe**, a **general physician** based in **New York**, specializing in **preventative healthcare**.
